      <h1>Birth control and family planning</h1>
      <p>Your choice of a birth control method depends on a number of factors, including your health, how often you have sex, and whether or not you want children.</p>
      
<h2>Information</h2>
      
Here are some questions to consider when selecting a birth control method:
<ul>
 <li>How well does the method prevent pregnancy? To tell how well a method works, look at the number of pregnancies in 100 women using that method over a period of 1 year.</li>
<li>What are your feelings about getting pregnant? Would an unplanned pregnancy create hardship or distress to a woman or her partner? Or would a pregnancy be welcomed if it occurred earlier than planned?</li>
<li>How much does a method of birth control cost? Does your insurance plan pay for it?</li>
<li>What are the health risks? Talk about these risks with your health care provider before believing what you hear from others.</li>
<li>Is your partner willing to accept and use a given method of birth control?</li>
<li>Do you want a method that you only need to use when you have sex? Or do you want something that is in place and always working?</li>
<li>Is preventing infections spread by sexual contact important? Many methods do not protect you from sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Condoms are the best choice for preventing STIs. They work best when combined with spermicides.</li>
<li>Availability: Can the method be used without a prescription, a provider visit, or, in the case of minors, parental consent?</li>
</ul>
      
      <h2>Methods of Birth Control</h2>
      <h3>Condoms:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A condom is a thin latex or polyurethane sheath. The male condom is placed around the erect penis. The female condom is placed inside the vagina before intercourse.</li>
<li>A condom must be worn at all times during intercourse to prevent pregnancy.</li>
<li>Condoms can be bought in most drug and grocery stores. Some family planning clinics offer free condoms. You do not need a prescription to get condoms.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Diaphragm and Cervical CAP:</h3>
<ul>
<li>a diaphragm is a flexible rubber cup that is filled with spermicidal cream or jelly</li>
<li>it is placed into the vagina over the cervix before intercourse, to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus</li>
<li>it should be left in place for 6 to 8 hours after intercourse</li>
<li>Diaphragms must be prescribed by a woman's provider (the provider will determine the correct type and size of diaphragm for the woman)</li>
<li>about 5 to 20 pregnancies occur over 1 year in 100 women using this method, depending on proper use</li>
<li>a similar, smaller device is called a cervical cap</li>
<li>Risks include irritation and allergic reactions to the diaphragm or spermicide, and increased frequency of urinary tract infection and vaginal yeast infection</li>
<li>in rare cases, toxic shock syndrome may develop in women who leave the diaphragm in too long. A cervical cap may cause an abnormal Pap test</li>
</ul>
